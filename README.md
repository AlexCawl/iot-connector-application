## Made by:

* AlexCawl [@fantasmagorius](https://t.me/fantasmagorius)

## Description

> It is a mobile client (Android) for viewing messages from a home MQTT server in a special,
> pre-defined format. Originally created for the sake of a screen with thermal matrices.
> There wasn't any determined design, so it is looking like a sandbox playground for anything
> @Composable.
